# spring-boot-docker

Simple "Hello World" application, built over spring-boot as an example case of a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) configuration.

It's configured to build up (and run if specified) a docker image through maven configuration, for this I'm making use of the [fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin).
